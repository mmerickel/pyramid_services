Changes
=======

unreleased
----------

- Drop support for Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7.

- Add support for Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12.

2.2 (2019-04-22)
----------------

- Depend on ``wired >= 0.2`` to use the new
  ``wired.ServiceContainer.register_singleton`` api.

2.1 (2018-08-03)
----------------

- Add a ``NewServiceContainer`` event that is emitted when the service
  container is created before any calls to ``request.find_service``.

2.0 (2018-08-03)
----------------

- Drop support for Python 2.7.

- Replace service lookup with https://wired.readthedocs.io under the hood.

- Fixes service lookup with custom contexts such that the context is passed
  through to nested service lookups.

1.1 (2017-05-31)
----------------

Features
++++++++

- If the ``iface`` is a class then it must be the exact class that was
  registered originally. Subclasses are not identified as implementing
  the same interface at this time due to internal limitations.

1.0 (2017-05-11)
----------------

Features
++++++++

- Allow the ``iface`` argument to be an arbitrary Python object / class.
  See https://github.com/mmerickel/pyramid_services/pull/10

Backward Incompatibilities
--------------------------

- Drop Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 support.

0.4 (2016-02-03)
----------------

Backward Incompatibilities
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Drop Python 3.2 support.

- Use the original service context interface as the cache key instead
  of the current context. This means the service will be properly created
  only once for any context satisfying the original interface.

  Previously, if you requested the same service from 2 different contexts
  in the same request you would receive 2 service objects, instead of
  a cached version of the original service, assuming the service was
  registered to satisfy both contexts.
  See https://github.com/mmerickel/pyramid_services/pull/12

0.3 (2015-12-13)
----------------

- When using ``request.find_service`` during or before traversal the
  ``request.context`` is not valid. In these situations the ``context``
  parameter will default to ``None`` instead of raising an exception.
  See https://github.com/mmerickel/pyramid_services/pull/8

- Add ``config.find_service_factory`` and ``request.find_service_factory``.
  See https://github.com/mmerickel/pyramid_services/pull/4

0.2 (2015-03-13)
----------------

- Change ``find_service(..., context=None)`` to use a context of ``None``.
  Previously this would fallback to using ``request.context`` if the
  ``context`` was ``None``. Now ``find_service`` will only fallback to
  ``request.context`` when no ``context`` argument is specified.
  See https://github.com/mmerickel/pyramid_services/pull/3

- Support ``introspectable`` for services so that they show up in the
  pyramid_debugtoolbar and elsewhere.
  See https://github.com/mmerickel/pyramid_services/pull/2

0.1.1 (2015-02-17)
------------------

- Support for ``request.find_service``, ``config.register_service``, and
  ``config.register_service_factory``.
- Initial commits.
